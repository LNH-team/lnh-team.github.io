## Our Projects

#### Dumping a 20 years old Game Boy prototype game

In 2022, we were offered an original Nintendo Game Boy development cartridge containing a beta/prototype version of the game Zidane Football Generation. Thanks to the community, we crowdfunded the purchase, obtained the cartridge and dumped the game! You can download the prototype [here](https://archive.org/details/zidane-generation-prototype) and watch the live dump (1 hour) [on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMJN99htsL8).

#### Nintendo DS Hidden TV Output

During late 2020, we discovered that the Nintendo DS Lite had a leftover feature in its SoC allowing it to easily have hardware video output. With a little circuitry and some software hacks, we were able to restore it and make it usable for anyone! No FPGA's, no bulky or cumbersome hardware.
