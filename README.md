#### Nintendo DS Hidden TV Output

During late 2020, we discovered that the Nintendo DS Lite had a leftover feature in its SoC allowing it to easily have hardware video output. With a little circuitry and some software hacks, we were able to restore it and make it usable for anyone! No FPGA's, no bulky or cumbersome hardware.
