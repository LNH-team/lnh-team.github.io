#### Nintendo DS Hidden TV Output

During late 2020, we discovered that the Nintendo DS (both Nintendo DS Phat and Nintendo DS Lite) had a leftover feature in the SoC allowing it to have hardware video output. With a little circuitry and some hacks, we were able to restore it and make it usable for anyone! Click [here](aaa.com) to see the project page.
